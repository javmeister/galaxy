# Velorum Galaxy Map

The Velorum Galaxy 3D map made with ThreeJS.

## Description

This is a 3D map of the Velorum Galaxy made with ThreeJS. It is served as a very basic Angular application with just a couple of routes. 

The Galaxy contains more than one hundred thousand solar systems, grouped into 2,000+ hexagonal shaped sectors. The Galaxy was randomly generated and the data for the sectors, solar systems, and planets is stored as compressed JSON files in our CDN.

The map is rendered using WebGL and the ThreeJS library. The map is interactive and allows the user to zoom in and out, rotate, and pan the map. The map also allows the user to select a solar system and view the details of that solar system.

## Getting Started

The app is hosted in this repository's Github Pages with a custom domain: https://galaxy.javierlerones.dev. Feel free to open it, but be aware the CDN data files might be broken or outdated, causing loading errors.
